1. Main Compute Unit

Raspberry Pi 4B

Recommended 4GB or 8GB RAM for faster inference.

Quad-core ARM Cortex-A72 CPU @ 1.5GHz.

USB 3.0 ports for faster camera and storage access.

Optional: heatsink/fan for thermal stability during heavy inference.

2. Camera

USB Webcam (plug-and-play)

Resolution: 720p or 1080p is sufficient for detection.

FPS: At least 30fps for smoother real-time detection.

Raspberry Pi Camera Module v2 or HQ Camera

Resolution: 8MP–12MP

Compatible with CSI interface for lower CPU usage.

High-quality images help YOLOv3 detect anomalies more accurately.

3. Storage

microSD Card

Minimum: 32GB (Class 10 or above)

Recommended: 64GB–128GB for storing dataset, trained models, and logs.

Preferably UHS-1 or UHS-3 for faster read/write.

Optional: External SSD (USB 3.0)

For large datasets or recording dashcam footage.

Faster and more reliable than microSD for continuous operation.

4. Power Supply

Official Raspberry Pi 4 Power Supply

5V, 3A USB-C.

Ensure stable power to avoid crashes during heavy inference.

5. Optional Display / Monitor

HDMI monitor for development and testing.

Not required for deployment if running headless (via SSH).

6. Cooling

Passive heatsinks or small fan for Raspberry Pi 4B.

Necessary if running YOLOv3 continuously in real-time to prevent thermal throttling.

7. Networking / Data Transfer

Wi-Fi or Ethernet for uploading results or updating software.

Optional: USB flash drive for dataset transfer.

8. Mounting / Dashcam Integration (Optional)

If deploying in a car:

Mount for camera.

Secure Raspberry Pi enclosure.

Proper cable management to avoid vibrations affecting camera feed.
